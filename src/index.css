/* Tailwind v4 changed the directive names:
   - `@tailwind base` was replaced by an import of the "preflight" layer
     (`@import "tailwindcss/preflight"`).
   - `@tailwind components` has been removed entirely; utility classes go
     directly under `@tailwind utilities` now.
   The editor was flagging the old rules as errors, so we switch to the
   recommended syntax. */

/* Add any project-level custom styles below. Keep this file focused on
   Tailwind layers; package.json contents don't belong here and were
   accidentally pasted into this CSS file (that caused the red errors).
